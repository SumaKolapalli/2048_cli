Rules of the game:

The goal of the game is to merge numbers together in order to reach the 2048 tile.

It is a 4*4 arena with 16 squared slots.

At the begining of the game we start with two tiles.

When we combine two tiles with the same number they merge into new on with a number that is the sum of the constituent numbers.

Best strategy to win at 2048 is to employ the corner method.

Any new number can appear in the game be it 2, 4 and so on. ( From observation a 2 or 4 can pop up in the game.);

We will make three versions of the product.

Version 0.1 : A cli version of the game.
